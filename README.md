# subfinder_everyday


This tool helps you track changes and additions to subdomains over time using **Subfinder**. Each time you run the tool, it only shows you the new subdomains that have been added since the last run. This allows you to easily determine what new subdomains have been added to your organization, for example, this week or today, compared to the previous week or day.

## Features

- **Track subdomain changes**: Instead of showing all subdomains every time, it only displays newly added subdomains.
- **Result storage**: Every time the tool runs, it saves the subdomains detected and compares them with future results.
- **Easy identification**: New subdomains are highlighted in green for easy identification

# Use : 
To provide input to the tool so that it searches for the target address you want, use the command: `nano subfinder_everyday.py` and change the value of `target_domain = "example.com"` on the last line.

Run the tool :â€Œ
  python3 subfinder_everyday.py
 
## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
